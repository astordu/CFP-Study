# Daily English Review - Today

**Task**: Generate a contextual review article for today's learning.

## Instructions:

1. **Read today's learning notes**: 
   - Check `/learn-notes/` for today's date (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
   - If arguments provided, use that date instead

2. **Extract all learning items**:
   - Vocabulary and phrases
   - Grammar points
   - Failed review items (re-added)

3. **Create a coherent story** (200-300 words):
   - Naturally integrate ALL target words/phrases
   - **Bold** the target items (e.g., **ephemeral**)
   - Ensure the story makes contextual sense

4. **Save the article**:
   - Create file in `/review-article/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
   - Include:
     - Scope: Today's Content
     - The Story (with bolded targets)
     - Target List (all items covered)

5. **Present to student**:
   - Show the article
   - Ask them to read and identify any parts they don't understand
   - If they don't understand something, re-add it to TODAY's learn-notes

## ⚠️ Critical Rules:
- ONLY use words/grammar from the actual learn-notes file
- Do NOT add random vocabulary
- If they can't recognize a word in the review, it goes back to learn-notes
