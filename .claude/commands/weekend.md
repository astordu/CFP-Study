   - List ALL vocabulary, phrases, and grammar points encountered

2. **Identify key items**:
   - Most frequently appearing items
   - Items that were re-added (indicating difficulty)
   - Important grammar structures

3. **Create a comprehensive story** (400-500 words):
   - Naturally weave in the key learning points
   - **Bold** all target items
   - Make the story engaging and contextually coherent
   - Can use multiple paragraphs/sections if needed

4. **Save the article**:
   - Create file in `/review-article/YYYY-MM-DD-weekly.md`
   - Include:
     - Scope: Past 7 Days (or custom range)
     - Date range covered
     - The Story (with bolded targets)
     - Comprehensive target list organized by:
       - Vocabulary/Phrases

       - Review frequency (if re-added multiple times)

5. **Present to student**:
   - Show the article
   - Highlight any items that appeared multiple times
   - Ask for feedback on difficult parts

## ⚠️ Critical Rules:

- ONLY use words/grammar from actual learn-notes files
- Include date range in the article header
- Any misunderstood items → back to TODAY's learn-notes
